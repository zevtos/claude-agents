# agentpipe

Gated pipeline orchestration for Claude Code and Codex CLI: specialist agents, slash commands, and skills.
9 agents, 15 commands, 1 skill (`gost-report`), 14 research docs. Multi-target installer:
default puts everything in `~/.claude/`; `--target codex` puts skills in `~/.agents/skills/`
(open-agent-skills standard) and skips agents/commands (Codex format differences).
The only build step is packaging skills into release zips — no runtime, no tests, no dependencies.

## Commands

```
bash install.sh                       # install for Claude Code (default)
bash install.sh --target codex        # install for Codex CLI (skills only)
bash install.sh --dry                 # preview what would change (works with --target too)
bash install.sh --diff                # show repo vs installed differences
bash install.sh --pull                # copy installed back to repo
bash install.sh --update              # git pull --ff-only, then install (alias of update.sh)
bash install.sh --uninstall           # remove installed files (target-scoped)
bash update.sh                        # canonical update entry point (forwards to install.sh --update)
bash install.sh --no-claude-md        # skip baseline CLAUDE.md (default: install-if-missing)
bash install.sh --with-sound-hooks    # opt-in: Stop+Notification sound hooks (OS auto-detect)
bash install.sh --with-thinking-summaries  # opt-in: showThinkingSummaries=true
bash install.sh --model-profile opus  # all agents on opus (default: mixed; persisted to settings.json)
bash scripts/build-skills.sh          # package every skills/<name>/ into dist/<name>.zip
bash scripts/eval.sh --list           # list local agent eval scenarios (no claude calls)
bash scripts/eval.sh <agent>          # run agent prompt-quality eval (uses claude -p, ~2 msgs/scenario)
```

## Structure

```
agents/*.md             Agent definitions — YAML frontmatter + system prompt

## Agent Format (agents/*.md)

YAML frontmatter then markdown body. Exact fields:

```
name:         lowercase identifier (architect, dba, devops, docs, pm, refactorer, reviewer, security, tester)
description:  trigger sentence with "MUST BE USED when/before..." conditions
tools:        comma-separated allowlist from: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch
model:        opus (for architect, security) or sonnet (all others)
```

Tool scoping by role:
- Read-only + web research: `Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch` (architect, pm)
- Read + diagnostic bash: `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` (dba, reviewer, security)
- Full write access: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep` (devops, tester, docs)

Body structure:
- `# [Role] Agent` — H1 title
- `## Core Responsibilities` — numbered list
- Domain-specific sections — rules, checklists, decision tables
- `## Output Format` or equivalent (e.g. `## Specification Format`) — template the agent must follow
- `## Handoff Protocol` — `## Next Steps` with `RECOMMEND:` lines to other agents

## Command Format (commands/*.md)

YAML frontmatter then markdown body. Exact fields:

```
description:    quoted string, one sentence explaining the command
argument-hint:  (optional) placeholder shown to user, e.g. <feature description>
```

Body structure:
- `## Context` containing `@CLAUDE.md` — always present, loads project instructions
- `$ARGUMENTS` under a descriptive heading — present when argument-hint exists
- `## Pipeline` with `### Step N: Name` — sequential, gated steps (most commands)
- Loop-style commands (e.g. sprint) use `## Loop` with `### Phase N:` instead
- Agent invocation: `Run the [name] agent:` followed by prompt in quotes

Commands without argument-hint: next, onboard, deploy.
Commands that run agents in parallel: review (reviewer + security), feature step 5.

## Skill Format (skills/<name>/)

Each skill is its own folder under `skills/`. Required files at the folder root:
- `SKILL.md` — YAML frontmatter (`name` matching folder, `description` trigger sentence) + body
- `LICENSE` — every skill ships its own license so the standalone `.zip` is legally usable when uploaded to Claude Chat or extracted into `~/.claude/skills/`. Default is MIT (matches repo top-level)

Optional folders inside the skill:
- `scripts/`    — supporting code (Python, Bash, etc.) the skill calls or references
- `references/` — long-form reference material (checklists, specs) loaded on demand

Body structure of `SKILL.md`:
- `# <Skill name>` — H1 title
- `## When to use` — concrete triggers, examples in user's language if domain-specific
- `## How to use` — minimal example + API reference
- `## Dependencies` — pip/system packages needed
- `## License` — one-line pointer to the `LICENSE` file
- `## Checklist` (optional) — final verification steps before delivering output

Skills are installed as folders to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` and discovered by Claude through their description. Don't add new top-level frontmatter fields — Claude Code ignores them silently.

## Conventions

- Commit messages: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- Branch strategy for this repo: main only. (Commands like /sprint auto-detect the repository's default branch.)
- Agents and commands are .md files. Skills are folders with SKILL.md plus optional scripts/references. No code generation, no templates.
- Installer must stay POSIX-safe: `set -euo pipefail`, no bashisms beyond what install.sh already uses.
- Installer must keep both `install.sh` and `install.ps1` in sync: same flags, same `--target` set, same skip-rules per target. When adding a new target, update the `case "$TARGET"` block in install.sh AND the `switch ($Target)` in install.ps1, plus the `[ValidateSet(...)]` attribute and the README target table.
- Arithmetic: use `$((count + 1))` not `((count++))`. The latter exits non-zero on zero under set -e.
- VERSION file: single line, semver, no v prefix. Installers and the release workflow read it at runtime.
- CHANGELOG.md: Keep a Changelog format. Update on every release.
- Agent descriptions are triggers, not summaries. Write for the model to understand WHEN to fire.
- Skill descriptions follow the same trigger principle and may include foreign-language keywords if the skill is domain-specific (see skills/gost-report).
- No @-importing files in agent bodies — bloats every session.
- Model assignment: opus for high-reasoning roles (architect, security). sonnet for everything else. This is the canonical `mixed` profile baked into `agents/*.md` source. Users can override at install time via `--model-profile opus|sonnet|mixed`; the installer rewrites the `model:` line at copy time without touching source files.
- Research docs are reference material. Agents do not auto-import them.
- Releases: bump VERSION → update CHANGELOG → commit → `git tag vX.Y.Z` → push tag. The release workflow builds skill zips and attaches them to the GitHub release.

## Do Not

- Add test files or test frameworks. Validation is via real usage, not test harnesses.
- Add CI workflows beyond `.github/workflows/release.yml` (skill packaging) unless the project gains an actual test suite.
- Create a `.claude/` directory in the repo. It is gitignored. The repo IS the source for `~/.claude/`.
- Add new frontmatter fields beyond what is documented above. Claude Code ignores unknown fields silently.
- Change installer flags without updating both install.sh and install.ps1.
- Put implementation details in agent or skill descriptions. Descriptions say WHEN to invoke, not HOW.
- Commit anything under `dist/` — it is generated by `scripts/build-skills.sh` and gitignored.

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/name.md` with frontmatter: name, description, tools, model
2. Description must contain "MUST BE USED when/before..." trigger language
3. Choose tools by role: read-only agents get no Write/Edit, write agents get full access
4. Choose model: opus only if the role requires deep multi-step reasoning
5. Include Handoff Protocol section with RECOMMEND: lines to related agents
6. Update README.md agents table, docs/agents.md, and CHANGELOG.md
7. Run `./install.sh` to deploy, then test the agent in a real project

## Adding a New Command

1. Create `commands/name.md` with frontmatter: description, argument-hint (if it takes args)
2. Body starts with `## Context` containing `@CLAUDE.md`
3. If it takes arguments: add `$ARGUMENTS` under a descriptive heading
4. Pipeline uses `### Step N: Name` structure with agent prompts in quotes
5. Each step that invokes an agent: "Run the `name` agent:" followed by prompt
6. Update README.md commands table, docs/commands.md, and CHANGELOG.md
7. Run `bash install.sh` to deploy, then test the command in a real project

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter: `name` (must equal the folder name) and `description` (trigger sentence)
2. Body explains *when* the skill applies, then *how* to use it (minimal example + API reference)
3. Add `skills/<name>/LICENSE` (MIT by default — copy from `skills/gost-report/LICENSE` and update the year/owner)
4. Optional: `skills/<name>/scripts/` for supporting code, `skills/<name>/references/` for long-form docs
5. Update README.md skills table and CHANGELOG.md
6. Run `bash install.sh` to deploy locally, then test by invoking the skill in a real project
7. Run `bash scripts/build-skills.sh` to verify the release archive builds cleanly and includes LICENSE

## Contributing

Fork the repo. Branch from main. PR to main.
Keep agent prompts specific and actionable. Avoid vague instructions.
Every PR must update relevant docs (README, docs/, CHANGELOG.md).
